 Experiment: LED BLINKING WITH ARDUINO
 Objective: The main objective of this experiment to learn the basics of the microcontroller using the Arduino.
 Apparatus: Microcontroller of Arduino board USB B cable LED Resistor(1kohm) Jumper wires Battery Power Source
 Working Procedure: *After completing software installation and coding upload unplug the board.
                    *Connect output pin number of Arduino board with resistor. *Connect resistor with positive terminal of LED. 
                    *Connect negative terminal of LED withground pin of Arduino.
                    *Supply power to Arduino board board by USB B wire or external power port
  Precautions: *All the connections should be tight and proper.
               *Handle the Arduino board carefully. 
               *Check connections again before program starts to execute. 
               *Switch of the Arduino board after performing the experiment.
 Result: After executing the programming the LED connected to the Arduino board will glow when it is high.
